## Techpoint Build 2022 Attendee - Favour Chukwuedo

It was great to see the amazing Tech solutions young people are building at the just concluded Techpoint Build 2022. 

The event was an opportunity to engage with partners, academia, governments and developers – driving impact in sectors important to the continent across #EdTech, #HealthTech, #PropTech, #FinTech, #AgriTech and OffGrid energy. #TechTwitter

While there’s still so much work to be done in building our talent pipeline, it’ll be great to see more partnerships with local universities to create a modern intelligent digital literacy curriculum, totally unique to Africa.
